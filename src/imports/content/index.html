<h3>recipease</h3>

<p>
	We, at synapticloop, like food, and we like recipes, and we are happy to share 
	them with everybody.  This is a simple recipe book creator (in PDF format) for 
	both desktop and mobile platforms.  This makes it easy to carry around and view 
	at the times when you need it most.
</p>

<p>
	There are two file formats, the <code>recipease.json</code> file and the 
	individual <code>recipe.json</code>files.
</p>

<h4><code>recipease.json</code></h4>

<p><em>This file can actually be named anything that you want</em></p>

<p>
	This file is the main file which then references the individual recipes, collating 
	them into a nice PDF document.
</p>

<p>
	This file has the following layout:
</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>title</strong> The title for the recipe book</li>
	<li><strong>image</strong> A nice image for the book (optional)</li>
	<li>
		<strong>sections</strong> The sections of the recipe book, each section has 
		the following layout:
		<ol>
			<li><strong>title</strong> The title for the section, e.g. dinner, lunch, sides, cakes etc.</li>
			<li><strong>image</strong> An (optional image) for the section</li>
			<li><strong>recipes</strong> The recipes that belong in the section.  All of the recipes are imported from separate files.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
