	"ingredients": [

"1 1/2 cup all purpose flour",
"1/2 tsp baking soda",
"1/2 cup natural cocoa powder",
"1 1/3 cups granulated sugar",
"3/4 cup unsalted butter, room temp",

"1 tbsp vanilla",
"1/3 cup plain, honey, or vanilla greek yogurt",
"1/2 cup boiling water",
"2 oz dark chocolate, chopped",

	],
	"directions": [

"Preheat the oven to 325ÂºF.",
"In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla, and yogurt. ",
"Start the mixer on low speed until the ingredients are moistened, and then turn to medium and mix until smooth and creamy.",
"Slowly drizzle in the hot water and mix on low speed until the batter becomes a thin liquid consistency.",
"Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and stir in the chocolate and raspberries.",
"Pour the batter into a 9 x 4 inch non-stick loaf pan, or if you don't have a non-stick pan, line a regular pan with parchment paper. ",
"If you have any left-over raspberries, you can gently press them into the top of the loaf.",
"Bake in the oven for roughly 1 hr 20 min - 1 hr 30 min, or until the loaf splits down the middle, is hard on the outside and soft on the inside. When you touch the top it should feel hard, not soft and jiggly. If you insert a toothpick to test for doneness, it may come out slightly wet, because the batter around the raspberries will be slightly moist. Remove from the oven and let cool.",
"When you remove the loaf from the pan, it will be very delicate. Turn the pan of its side and gently tap the cake onto a piece of parchment paper. Can be stored in the fridge for up to a week."
