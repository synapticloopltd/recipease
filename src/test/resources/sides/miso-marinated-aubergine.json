	"ingredients": [
		"§Aubergine",
		"1 aubergine, small, or 2 Asian eggplants",
		"2 tbsp of groundnut oil",
		"§Hatcho miso marinade",
		"1 tbsp of hatcho miso paste",
		"1 tbsp of runny honey",
		"1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil",
		"5 tbsp of hot water",
		"§To serve",
		"1 tbsp of sesame seeds",
		"1 spring onion, finely chopped"
	],

	"directions": [
		"In a shallow dish, stir together the ingredients for the marinade until everything is well mixed, adding just enough hot water to loosen the miso and honey",
		"Slice the aubergine in half lengthwise, then score the flesh with a knife cutting deep into the flesh without cutting through the skin. Make diagonal cuts about an inch apart, and then repeat in the other direction so you have a diamond pattern",
		"Place the aubergine in the dish, cut-side down. Make sure the surface and insides of the slits are all smeared with the marinade. Leave to marinate for at least 30 minutes",
		"When almost ready to roast, preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6. Get ready a baking tray and sheet of baking paper large enough to wrap the aubergine",
		"Remove the aubergine from the marinade and place cut-side up on the baking paper. Bring the edges of the baking paper together and twist to seal, making a little parcel. Place in oven and roast for 20 minutes",
		"After 20 minutes, take the tray out of the oven and open up the parcel. Smear the aubergines with more of the reserved marinade and drizzle the with groundnut oil. Return to the oven and roast uncovered for another 20–30 minutes, or until the flesh is very tender, almost collapsing, and the tops are caramelized",
		"Remove from oven and scatter the sesame seeds and spring onions over to finish. Allow to cool slightly before digging in"
