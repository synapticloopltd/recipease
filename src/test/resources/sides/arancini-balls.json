	"ingredients": [
		"Pre-made Risotto",
		"1/2 a bunch of fresh oregano , (15g)",
		"1 x 150 g ball of mozzarella cheese",
		"100 g caciocavallo cheese",
		"150 g semi-dried tomatoes"
	],

	"directions": [
		"Chop the mozzarella, caciocavallo cheese, and the tomatoes, then combine with the oregano and lemon zest. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper.",
		"To form the arancini, scoop a portion of the cooled risotto into your hand. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the filling mixture into the centre and wrap the risotto around it to seal completely. Repeat with the remaining risotto and filling.",
		"For the pane, place the flour, beaten eggs and breadcrumbs into separate shallow bowls. Carefully dip each arancini ball into the flour, shaking off any excess, then the egg, and finally the crumbs, ensuring the rice is completely coated. Set aside. ",
		"Pour the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over a high heat. To test the oil is ready, drop in a few breadcrumbs â€“ if they sizzle and float, it is ready.",
		"Carefully lower in the arancini with a slotted spoon, in batches of four, and deep-fry for 8 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain.",
		"Delicious served with fried capers, fresh oregano and basil leaves, grated Parmesan and the punchy arrabbiata sauce for dunking."
