"Arrange the slices of sweet potato in a deep, medium-sized ovenproof dish by taking tight packs of them and standing them up next to each other.",
"They should fit together quite tightly so you get parallel lines of sweet potato slices (skins showing) along the length or width of the dish.",

"Cover the dish with foil, place in the oven and roast for 45 minutes.",
"Remove the foil and pour the cream evenly over the potatoes.",
