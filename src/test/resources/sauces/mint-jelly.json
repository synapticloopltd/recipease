	],

	"ingredients": [
		"4 lbs of tart apples (e.g. Granny Smith), un-peeled, chopped into big pieces, including the cores (including the cores is important as this is where most of the natural pectin is)",
		"1 1/2 cups of fresh mint, chopped, lightly packed",
		"2 cups water",
		"2 cups white vinegar",
		"3 1/2 cups sugar (7/8 cups for each cup of juice)"
	],

	"directions": [
		"Combine apple pieces with water and mint in a large pan. Bring water to a boil then reduce heat and cook for twenty minutes, until apples are soft.",
		"Add vinegar, return to boil. Simmer covered, for five minutes.",
		"Use a potato masher to mash the apple pieces to the consistency of apple sauce.",
		"Spoon the apple pulp into a muslin cloth (or a couple layers of cheesecloth) suspended over a large bowl. Leave to strain for several hours. Do not squeeze as this will make the jelly cloudy.",
		"Pour juice into a large pan. Add the sugar.",
		"Heat gently, stirring to make sure the sugar gets dissolved and doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan and burn.",
		"Bring to a boil. Cook for ten to fifteen minutes, using a spoon to skim off the surface scum. Continue to boil for five minutes.",
		"Pour into sterilized jars to within 1/4\" from the top and seal."
	],

	"notes": [
		"The tarter the apples, the more pectin they will usually have. If you are using home picked apples, earliest in the season is best, and the smaller apples will have proportionally more pectin as well",
		"You may wish to also add some finely chopped mint leaves to the mix for some added flavour and colour"
